**I'm a web application developer for [Dave Ramsey](https://ramseysolutions.com) in Nashville, TN.**

My family and I moved here in 2015 from Minnesota, where "soda" is just short for the stuff you mix with vinegar to make a volcano for a junior high science fair. I love what I do, and it's a privilege to do it for a mission that matters.

**I can't seem to get sick of tinkering with software.**

I love dabbling in new technologies, often turning them into [personal projects](/projects). On the whole, this tinkering stays within the Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript spaces.

**I can help build or optimize your website or application.**

Whether it's the front, back, or middle of the stack, I'm open to collaborating on your digital needs in whatever way I can. Some of examples of what that might look like:

- Building performant, SEO-friendly website for your small business.
- Consulting on front-end performance issues you've been experiencing.
- Making a REST or GraphQL API to meet a bespoke business need.
- Designing & implementing a caching strategy for your application.

That list isn't exhaustive. If you need some help, [let's connect](/contact) to get the process started. If web forms are scary, you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amacarthur), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmacarthur/), or [email](mailto:alex@macarthur.me).
