title: Banal literary hook.
---

You started a post with a phrase that couldn't be any less original or more clich√©. Reaching for hooks like "unpopular opinion," "CONFESSION," or "I don't know who needs to hear this" signals a severe lack of originality, and greatly undermines your credibility as a content creator who's capable of giving us anything of substance to ponder.

When you're drafting a post, read it aloud to yourself and ask, "Have I ever heard this used by an unemployed, Instagram-addicted, 20-something thought leader with a PopSocket on her phone?" If the answer is yes, never utter that phrase in any context for the rest of your life.
