title: Banal literary hook.

You started a post with a phrase that couldn't be any less original or more clich√©. When you're drafting a post, read it aloud to yourself and ask, "Have I ever heard this used by an unemployed, Instagram-addicted, 20-something thought leader with a PopSocket on her phone?" If the answer is yes, never utter that phrase in any context for the rest of your life.
